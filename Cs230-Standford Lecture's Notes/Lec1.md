# Why  is deep learning Taking Off?
The deep learning is taking of for the multiple reasons please have look at the following Image

- The red line describes about the traiditional machine learning algorithms which have less performance as compare to NN.
- The Yellow line describes about the   small neural networks which have less performance as compared to medium NN.
- The blue line describes about the   medium neural networks which have less performance as compared to large NN.
- The Green line describes that the large NN performance is very high as comapared to all of them




# Difference b/w software Engineering and Deep learning Engineer

- Defining a High level features describes that how good the software engineer is.
- In deep learning the decision that a deep learning engineer make would be test for e.g . If he is in a scenarion which decsion would be benifit for the company
   - Searching for the hyperparameter  OR.
   - Collect more data.

It is not about the implementation it is about the details.

Shopping Mall + website  != internet company

its mean that if you have a shopping mall which has the online website does not mean that you are an e-commerece. Clearly there is differnce between the approach between this company and amazon the difference is
- A/B Testing
- Short Shipping Time
- Decision Making by Engineer's not by product managers


# Company + Neural Netwrok != AI Company

AI Teams 
- Strategic data accquistaion (some data accquistion techniques may not make sense on surface level but they certainly do)
- Monitor data
- Unified Data Ware Houses
- pervasive automation
- New Job description(ML, CV, DATA Scientist)

Product manager behaves differntly
