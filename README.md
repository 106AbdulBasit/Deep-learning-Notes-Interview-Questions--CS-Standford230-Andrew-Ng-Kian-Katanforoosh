##  Question -What is Neural Network

To understand the neural network lets have a look at the simplest form of the neural network


![Example2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/106AbdulBasit/Deep-learning-Notes-Interview-Questions--CS-Standford230-Andrew-Ng-Kian-Katanforoosh/main/Images/Single%20Neuron.PNG)

The input to the neural network is the size of the house which is denoted by the x.  In the middle, we have the circle which is the single neuron and input goes into this neuron and it output the price which is denoted as Y. The neuron implements the function which is drawn on the left. This function takes the max of zero and then outputs the estimated price. 

So input goes into neuron , the neuron computes the linear function and output the prediction(estimated price).  
 In this example the linear function is Rectified Linear Unit.
