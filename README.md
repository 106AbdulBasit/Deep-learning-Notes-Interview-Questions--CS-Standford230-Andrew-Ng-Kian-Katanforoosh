# Deep-learning-Notes-Interview-Questions--CS-Standford230-Andrew-Ng-Kian-Katanforoosh
This repository contains the  notes from the standord cs 230 autum class

The class was in the format of the flip in which the students were asked to watch the content of the deep learning on the coursera and in the class the time was utilesed for the discussion for the boarder prospective
#Deeplearing # MachineLearning #Stanford



# Lecture 1
The lecture one contains the content from the week1 of the Nueral Network and deep learning

Week 1
- Neural Network
- Supervised Learning

The details notes can be found in this [link](https://github.com/106AbdulBasit/Deep-learning-Notes-Interview-Questions--CS-Standford230-Andrew-Ng-Kian-Katanforoosh/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20&%20Deep%20Learning/Week%201.md)

In this vedio  Sir Andrew talk about
- why deep learning is taking off?
- What is difference between SE and DL.
