# Deep-learning-Notes-Interview-Questions--CS-Standford230-Andrew-Ng-Kian-Katanforoosh
The aim of the repository is to make the resource in which all the course notes will be covered and with possible interviwe questions as well.

In the class of CS the structure of  the class was  flip class format. In this format the students were asked to watch the vedios which were of coursera Deep learning .ai  and in the class there were discussion. 

In the repository I try to cover the content from the coursera and from the lectures as well.



# Lecture 1
In the content of week 1 these things were discussed.

- What is Neural Network
- Supervised Learning

The details notes is in the following [link](https://github.com/106AbdulBasit/Deep-learning-Notes-Interview-Questions--CS-Standford230-Andrew-Ng-Kian-Katanforoosh/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20%26%20Deep%20Learning/Week%201.md)
