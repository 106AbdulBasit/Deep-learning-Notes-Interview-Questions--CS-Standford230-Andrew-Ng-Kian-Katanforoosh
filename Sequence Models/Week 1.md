# Recurrent Neural Networks

## Why sequence models
- Sequence Models like RNN and LSTMs have greatly transformed learning on sequences in the past few years.
- Examples of sequence data in applications:
  - Speech recognition (sequence to sequence):
  - X: wave sequence
  - Y: text sequence
-  Music generation (one to sequence):
  - X: nothing or an integer
  - Y: wave sequence
- Sentiment classification (sequence to one):
  - X: text sequence
  - Y: integer rating from one to five
- DNA sequence analysis (sequence to sequence):
 - X: DNA sequence
 - Y: DNA Labels
- Machine translation (sequence to sequence):
 - X: text sequence (in one language)
 - Y: text sequence (in other language)
- Video activity recognition (sequence to one):
  - X: video frames
  - Y: label (activity)
- Name entity recognition (sequence to sequence):
  - X: text sequence
  - Y: label sequence
  - Can be used by seach engines to index different type of words inside a text.
- All of these problems with different input and output (sequence or not) can be addressed as supervised learning with
label data X, Y as the training set.

# Notation
- In this section we will discuss the notations that we will use through the course.
- Motivating example:
  - Named entity recognition example:
  - Y: 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
  - Both elements has a shape of 9. 1 means its a name, while 0 means its not a name.
- We will index the first element of x by x , the second x and so on.
  - x = Harry
  - x = Potter
- Similarly, we will index the first element of y by y , the second y and so on.
  - y = 1
  - y = 1
- T is the size of the input sequence and T is the size of the output sequence.
  - T = T = 9 in the last example although they can be different in other problems.
- x is the element t of the sequence of input vector i. Similarly y means the t-th element in the output sequence
of the i training example.
- T the input sequence length for training example i. It can be different across the examples. Similarly for T will be the
length of the output sequence in the i-th training example.

- Representing words:
  - We will now work in this course with NLP which stands for natural language processing. One of the challenges of
NLP is how can we represent a word?
  - We need a vocabulary list that contains all the words in our target sets.
  - Example:
   - [a ... And ... Harry ... Potter ... Zulu]
   - Each word will have a unique index that it can be represented with.
   - The sorting here is in alphabetical order.
  - Vocabulary sizes in modern applications are from 30,000 to 50,000. 100,000 is not uncommon. Some of the
bigger companies use even a million.
  - To build vocabulary list, you can read all the texts you have and get m words with the most occurrence, or
search online for m most occurrent words.

- Create a one-hot encoding sequence for each word in your dataset given the vocabulary you have created
  - While converting, what if we meet a word thats not in your dictionary?
  - We can add a token in the vocabulary with name <UNK> which stands for unknown text and use its index for
your one-hot
- Full example:
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/206914302-aee96bea-20bd-4dab-87b1-95e6065bc157.png)
  - The goal is given this representation for x to learn a mapping using a sequence model to then target output y as a
supervised learning problem
- Why not to use a standard network for sequence tasks? There are two problems:
  - Inputs, outputs can be different lengths in different examples.
  - This can be solved for normal NNs by paddings with the maximum lengths but it's not a good solution.
- Doesn't share features learned across different positions of text/sequence.
  - Using a feature sharing like in CNNs can significantly reduce the number of parameters in your model. That's
    what we will do in RNNs.
- Recurrent neural network doesn't have either of the two mentioned problems.
- Lets build a RNN that solves name entity recognition task:
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/206914391-ec1e1473-e9ed-48a3-903a-e4509dd56e91.png)
      - In this problem T = T . In other problems where they aren't equal, the RNN architecture may be different.
      - a is usually initialized with zeros, but some others may initialize it randomly in some cases.
      - There are three weight matrices here: W , W , and W with shapes:
        - W : (NoOfHiddenNeurons, n )
        - W : (NoOfHiddenNeurons, NoOfHiddenNeurons)
        - W : (n , NoOfHiddenNeurons)
      - The weight matrix W is the memory the RNN is trying to maintain from the previous layers.
      - A lot of papers and books write the same architecture this way:
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/206914489-8ee595ce-4129-4261-9647-2af5a74b321c.png)
    - It's harder to interpreter. It's easier to roll this drawings to the unrolled version.
  - In the discussed RNN architecture, the current output Å· depends on the previous inputs and activations.
  - Let's have this example 'He Said, "Teddy Roosevelt was a great president"'. In this example Teddy is a person name but
    we know that from the word president that came after Teddy not from He and said that were before it.
  - So limitation of the discussed architecture is that it can not learn from elements later in the sequence. To address this
    problem we will later discuss Bidirectional RNN (BRNN)
  - Now let's discuss the forward propagation equations on the discussed architecture:
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207071962-c2ae7150-3605-4aa4-a48b-0a79d4ce0a48.png)
  
  - The activation function of a is usually tanh or ReLU and for y depends on your task choosing some activation
    functions like sigmoid and softmax. In name entity recognition task we will use sigmoid because we only have two
    classes.
  - In order to help us develop complex RNN architectures, the last equations needs to be simplified a bit.
  - Simplified RNN notation:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207072246-df50ff6e-7832-46f6-8a9b-34d3cb6653d4.png)
    
    - w is w and w stacked horizontally.
    - [a , x ] is a and x stacked vertically.
    - w shape: (NoOfHiddenNeurons, NoOfHiddenNeurons + n )
    - [a , x ] shape: (NoOfHiddenNeurons + n , 1)
 
  # Backpropagation through time
  - Let's see how backpropagation works with the RNN architecture.
  - Usually deep learning frameworks do backpropagation automatically for you. But it's useful to know how it works in
    RNNs.
  - Here is the graph:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207072632-f69f54de-7ffb-4a66-9604-e991894cafb0.png)
    - Where w , b , w , and b are shared across each element in a sequence.
  - We will use the cross-entropy loss function:
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207072767-0f87da35-50da-40e2-99d0-50bf0138a448.png)

    - Where the first equation is the loss for one example and the loss for the whole sequence is given by the summation
     over all the calculated single example losses.
  - Graph with losses:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207072991-5dad62ca-b675-4f55-a450-b64092b9c801.png)

  - The backpropagation here is called backpropagation through time because we pass activation a from one sequence
    element to another like backwards in time.
  
  # Different types of RNNs
  
  - So far we have seen only one RNN architecture in which T equals T . In some other problems, they may not equal so we
need different architectures.
  - The ideas in this section was inspired by Andrej Karpathy blog. Mainly this image has all types:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207073257-eca2153f-b781-49a7-be78-0070b60fe244.png)

  - The architecture we have descried before is called Many to Many.
  - In sentiment analysis problem, X is a text while Y is an integer that rangers from 1 to 5. The RNN architecture for that is
Many to One as in Andrej Karpathy image.
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207073416-2f049547-7e06-43eb-80df-9f755c58bcc3.png)

 - A One to Many architecture application would be music generation.
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207073495-43174ed7-d830-4683-a4ed-0278c6cf53b0.png)

      - Note that starting the second layer we are feeding the generated output back to the network.
- There are another interesting architecture in Many To Many. Applications like machine translation inputs and outputs
sequences have different lengths in most of the cases. So an alternative Many To Many architecture that fits the
translation would be as follows:
- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207073783-ea80cb8b-7073-49c7-9c90-445aec5378c7.png)

    - There are an encoder and a decoder parts in this architecture. The encoder encodes the input sequence into one
matrix and feed it to the decoder to generate the outputs. Encoder and decoder have different weight matrices.
 - Summary of RNN types:

  - There is another architecture which is the attention architecture which we will talk about in chapter 3.
 
 

# Language model and sequence generation
  - RNNs do very well in language model problems. In this section, we will build a language model using RNNs.
  - What is a language model
  
     - Let's say we are solving a speech recognition problem and someone says a sentence that can be interpreted into to
two sentences:
      - The apple and pair salad
      - The apple and pear salad
    
    - Pair and pear sounds exactly the same, so how would a speech recognition application choose from the two.
    - That's where the language model comes in. It gives a probability for the two sentences and the application decides
      the best based on this probability.
  - The job of a language model is to give a probability of any given sequence of words.
  - How to build language models with RNNs?
    - The first thing is to get a training set: a large corpus of target language text.
    - Then tokenize this training set by getting the vocabulary and then one-hot each word.
    - Put an end of sentence token <EOS> with the vocabulary and include it with each converted sentence. Also, use the
      token <UNK> for the unknown words.
  - Given the sentence "Cats average 15 hours of sleep a day. <EOS> "
    - In training time we will use this:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207075283-12459a0d-7256-4476-84b7-15393f392909.png)

    - The loss function is defined by cross-entropy loss:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207075334-535ac69f-8d6c-4247-9703-17763503f0eb.png)
       - i is for all elements in the corpus, t - for all timesteps.
  - To use this model:
    - For predicting the chance of next word, we feed the sentence to the RNN and then get the final y^<t> hot vector
and sort it by maximum probability.
    - For taking the probability of a sentence, we compute this:
      - p(y , y , y ) = p(y ) * p(y | y ) * p(y | y , y )
      - This is simply feeding the sentence into the RNN and multiplying the probabilities (outputs).
  
  # Sampling novel sequences
  
  - After a sequence model is trained on a language model, to check what the model has learned you can apply it to sample
    novel sequence.
  - Lets see the steps of how we can sample a novel sequence from a trained sequence language model:
    - Given this model:
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36159918/207075982-0e10e71f-d54f-4e33-acf5-cb7e7926b30e.png)

    - We first pass a = zeros vector, and x = zeros vector.
    - iii. Then we choose a prediction randomly from distribution obtained by Å· . For example it could be "The".
      - In numpy this can be implemented using: numpy.random.choice(...)
      - This is the line where you get a random beginning of the sentence each time you sample run a novel sequence.
    - We pass the last predicted word with the calculated a<1>
    - v. We keep doing 3 & 4 steps for a fixed length or until we get the <EOS> token.
    - vi. You can reject any <UNK> token if you mind finding it in your output.
 - So far we have to build a word-level language model. It's also possible to implement a character-level language model.
 - In the character-level language model, the vocabulary will contain [a-zA-Z0-9] , punctuation, special characters and
possibly token
  
 - Character-level language model has some pros and cons compared to the word-level language model
    - Pros:
        a. There will be no <UNK> token - it can create any word.
    - Cons:
      a. The main disadvantage is that you end up with much longer sequences.
      b. Character-level language models are not as good as word-level language models at capturing long range
        dependencies between how the the earlier parts of the sentence also affect the later part of the sentence.
      c. Also more computationally expensive and harder to train.
- The trend Andrew has seen in NLP is that for the most part, a word-level language model is still used, but as computers
get faster there are more and more applications where people are, at least in some special cases, starting to look at
more character-level models. Also, they are used in specialized applications where you might need to deal with
unknown words or other vocabulary words a lot. Or they are also used in more specialized applications where you have
a more specialized vocabulary.
